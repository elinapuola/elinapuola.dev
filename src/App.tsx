              <p>
                I have experience working in software development, mostly from
                my time in a maintenance team, handling small-scale development
                and bug fixes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my
                existing skill set.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also have an AWS Certified Developer – Associate
                certification, which has provided me with a strong foundation
                for modern usage of cloud services in application development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently looking for work where I can hopefully put my
                certification knowledge to good use and learn some new practices
                and technologies.

                The bots functions are tested using unittest. The coverage of
                tests is 100 %.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was running on Google Cloud Run. It had a CD/CI
                pipeline from the GitHub repository.
              </p>
